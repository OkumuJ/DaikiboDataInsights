# Daikibo Telementary Insights

## Background information on the task 
After a worrisome number of internal complaints about gender inequality in terms of salary, Daikibo Industrials wants us to help them investigate.

The Forensic Tech team has built an algorithm to quantify “level of gender pay equality” for most job roles within the company, in all company locations. Our Forensics lead thinks it would be a great idea for you to finish the job.

## Task
All data on employee compensation have been generated into an Excel file (Equality Table.xlsx) containing 3 columns:

1. Factory
2. Job Role
3. Equality Score (integer; ranging between -100 and +100; 0 is ideal)
### Task:

Create a 4th column (Equality class), classifying the equality score into 3 types:
Fair (+-10)
Unfair (<-10 AND >10)
Highly Discriminative (<-20 AND >20)
Examples:

10 → Fair
-9 → Unfair
-30 → Highly Discriminative
